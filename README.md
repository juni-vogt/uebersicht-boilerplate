# uebersicht-boilerplate
Use node modules with [Übersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht)

Clone it to your widgets folder and start developing!

With uebersicht-boilerplate, you can make Übersicht widgets that use node modules to render output HTML.
It works by executing a js file with node, writing the output to a file and using cat to pipe the output to Übersicht.

Intended as a temporary hack until this is officially supported.
